# 1. Micro and Array Update
Micro purchased an array A having N integer values. After playing it for a while, he got
bored of it and decided to update value of its element. In one second he can increase
value of each array element by 1. He wants each array element's value to become greater
than or equal to K. Please help Micro to find out the minimum amount of time it will take,
for him to do so.

# Input:
First line consists of a single integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case consists of two space separated integers denoting N and K.
Second line of each test case consists of N space separated integers denoting the array
A.

# Output:
For each test case, print the minimum time in which all array elements will become
greater than or equal to K. Print a new line after each test case.

constraints:
 1<=T<=5
 1<=N<=10^5
 1<=A[i],K<=10^6

# 2. Hamiltonian and Lagrangian
Students have become secret admirers of SEGP. They find the course exciting and the
professors amusing. After a superb Mid Semester examination, itâ€™s now time for the
results. The TAs have released the marks of students in the form of an array, where arr[i]
represents the marks of the ith student.
Since you are a curious kid, you want to find all the marks that are not smaller than those
on its right side in the array.

# Input:
The first line of input will contain a single integer n denoting the number of students.
The next line will contain n space separated integers representing the marks of students.

# Output:
Output all the integers separated in the array from left to right that are not smaller than
those on its right side.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 1000000
0 <= arr[i] <= 10000

# 3. Frustrated coders
There are N frustrated coders standing in a circle with a gun in their hands. Each coder
has a skill value S[ i ] and he can only kill those coders that have strictly less skill than
him. One more thing, all the guns have only 1 bullet. This roulette can take place in
any random order. Fortunately, you have the time stone (haaan wo harre wala) and
you can see all possible outcomes of this scenario. Find the outcome where the total
sum of the remaining coder's skill is minimum. Print this sum.

# Input:
The first line contains N the no. of coders
The next line contains N elements where the ith element is theS[ i ] of ith coder.

# Output:
Print a single line containing the minimum sum.

Constraints:
1<= N <= 1000000
1<=S[ i ]<=1000

# 4. Pink Floyd and Happiness

Pink is sad because of some reasons, he wants to cheer up by listening to some songs from his favorite band, Pink Floyd.

There are N records and Pink will be happy if he listens to them in the ascending order, i.e., first the song No. 1, then No.2 and so on (He has to listen to all the N songs to become Happy).

Pink is delivered his records in some given order, he can either add the record to the Playlist in the delivered order or put some on another table. After being put on the table only the topmost record can be added to the playlist at any time.

Print whether Pink will be sad or happy after the delivery of the records.
# Input:
N - Number of records followed by
N numbers- order of records.

# Output:
Print "Happy" if the playlist has songs from 1 to N in order else "Sad".

Constraints:
1<=N<=10^5
The array consists of 1-N distinct numbers.

# 5.Hacker and traffic lights
Zolo is stuck in a traffic due to dysfunctional traffic light. Zolo is a professional hacker
and he can get into the system and change the state of the light. His planet has
different types of traffic lights such that there are N bulbs on the traffic board and
only when all of them are green(G) the cars can pass. there are 2 other states also
which the bulb can show; i.e. Red(R) & Yellow(Y). Note that the lights are designed
such that they follow a state change cyclic pattern as follows:
R------>Y------>G------->R
Once Zolo gets into the system he can select any position i and update all elements
between i to min(N, i + K - 1) by increasing their state by 1.This whole process takes
1 sec and he can repeat this process any no. of times until he gets all lights = G . Find
the minimum time to do the process as Zolo is getting late for work.

# Input:
The first line contains N K
The second line describes the current status of each bulb as an array whose each
element can either be G or Y or R.

# Output:
Print the minimum amount of time required to clear the traffic jam".

Constraints:
1<=N, K<=100000

# 6. Remove Friends
After getting her PhD, Christie has become a celebrity at her university, and her
Facebook profile is full of friend requests. Being the nice girl, she is, Christie has
accepted all the requests.
Now Kuldeep is jealous of all the attention she is getting from other guys, so he asks
her to delete some of the guys from her friend list.
To avoid a 'scene', Christie decides to remove some friends from her friend list, since
she knows the popularity of each of the friend she has, she uses the following
algorithm to delete a friend.

Algorithm Delete(Friend):
DeleteFriend=false
for i = 1 to Friend.length-1
if (Friend[i].popularity < Friend[i+1].popularity)
delete i th friend
DeleteFriend=true
break
if(DeleteFriend == false)
delete the last friend.

# Input:
First line contains T number of test cases. First line of each test case contains N, the
number of friends Christie currently has and K ,the number of friends Christie decides
to delete. Next lines contains popularity of her friends separated by space.

# Output:
For each test case print N-K numbers which represent popularity of Christie friend's
after deleting K friends.

Constraints:
1<=T<=1000
1<=N<=100000
0<=K< N
0<=popularity_of_friend<=100

# NOTE:
Order of friends after deleting exactly K friends should be maintained as given in
input.
